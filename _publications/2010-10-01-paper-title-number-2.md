This study proposes a living shoreline design for erosion mitigation at Main Beach, Byron Bay, NSW, Australia, using artificial submerged reefs (ARs) to complement hard engineering measures. The design aims to reduce wave energy and coastal erosion while promoting habitat restoration, with seagrass vegetation and reefs forming the core of the solution. The methodology includes a theoretical analysis of ARs, supported by a case study of the successful implementation of ARs in the Ramblers Road Foreshore project. Additionally, the SWASH model is employed to simulate wave dynamics and assess the performance of the proposed ARs under various scenarios. The study concludes that ARs can stabilize the shoreline, though high tidal and wave conditions may affect their long-term performance.
