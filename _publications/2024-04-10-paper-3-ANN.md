This assignment focuses on modeling rainfall-runoff using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models implemented with Python. It details the preprocessing of discharge data, selection of appropriate input features, and training techniques for the LSTM model. Various neural network architectures are evaluated, with the MLP model used for comparison. Forecasting accuracy is examined across 10-, 20-, and 60-minute intervals, highlighting LSTM's superiority in handling time-series data. The study demonstrates that LSTM offers higher accuracy and better performance in predicting rainfall-runoff trends, especially for short-term forecasts.<br/>
