This study investigates the optimization of the Shawan River channel in Shenzhen to enhance flood protection and balance sedimentation prevention with erosion control. Using MIKE and FLOW-3D models, the performance of natural and optimized channels under different flow conditions, including a 100-year return period storm, is analyzed. Results show that the optimized channel improves stability and efficiency, particularly in extreme conditions. A comparison of trapezoidal weirs with varying slopes highlights that milder slopes increase flow capacity, while steeper slopes heighten shear stress and erosion risks. These findings offer valuable insights for effective channel design.
