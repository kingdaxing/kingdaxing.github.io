This study proposes a living shoreline design for erosion mitigation at Main Beach, Byron Bay, Australia, utilizing artificial submerged reefs (ARs) as a nature-based solution (NbS). Byron Bay is experiencing significant coastal erosion, with current shoreline management focused on hard engineering approaches. ARs were selected, and their layout designed in the surf zone based on SWASH modeling results of wave dynamics, to attenuate wave energy, reduce sediment loss, and enhance ecosystem services. Site-specific geomorphology and wave transformation analysis informed the design, validated by a similar project in Australia. <br/>
The study concludes that ARs, coupled with seagrass restoration, can stabilize the shoreline and improve ecological conditions, though high wave and tidal conditions may limit their performance.
