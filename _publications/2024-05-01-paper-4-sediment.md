This report presents experiments conducted in a water-recirculating flume to study sediment transport, focusing on incipient sediment motion and sand ripples. The analysis uses Shields diagrams to assess the critical conditions for sediment movement, including incipient motion velocity and sand ripple formation. Post-processed Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) data provides insights into flow characteristics and sediment behavior. The experiments successfully validate the Shields parameter's prediction of sediment transport conditions, demonstrating the relationship between shear stress and particle Reynolds number, with key results visualized in modified Shields and Shields regime diagrams. <br/>
