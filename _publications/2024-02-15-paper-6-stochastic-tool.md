Earthmoving related activities have a stochastic nature that affects the project cost and duration. This research aims to provide a stochastic based decision-support tool for tree-cutting & earthmoving operations and achieve the best arrangement of equipment by utilizing historical data. Three kinds of PDFs are selected to represent observed data, including normal, beta and gamma distributions. After running simulation and doing trials and tests, a sensitivity analysis shows that the optimization objective is the number of trucks, a variable that plays a key role in controlling the process duration.
