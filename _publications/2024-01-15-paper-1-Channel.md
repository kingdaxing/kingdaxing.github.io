This study investigates the optimization of the Shawan River channel in Shenzhen, including channelization and overflow weirs, to enhance flood protection and stabilize flow. Using MIKE and FLOW3D models, we analyze the performance of both natural and widened channel configurations under various flow conditions. The results show that the optimized channel improves both stability and hydraulic efficiency, as demonstrated through a comparison of the minimum Froude number. A comparison of trapezoidal weirs with varying upstream slopes reveals that milder slopes increase flow capacity, whereas steeper slopes increase shear stress and bedload transport, further enhancing the risk of bed erosion and the formation of scour holes. These findings provide valuable insights for effective river training and channel design. <br/>
