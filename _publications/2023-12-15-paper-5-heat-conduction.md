This study developed a 2D transient heat conduction model for a plate with a central opening, employing Central Difference Method (CDM) for steady-state temperature calculations and Forward Time Central Space strategy (FTCS) for transient heat analysis, using schemes like Backward Time Central Space and FDM, while assessing the impact of boundary conditions and stability on the numerical solutions. <br/>
That also developed my numerical differentiation techniques for solving PDEs in MATLAB. <br/>
