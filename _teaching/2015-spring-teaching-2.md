The Estuary Channel Realignment and Seawall Construction project aims to realign an estuary channel, and reconstruct relative seawall to allow the artificial river to seamlessly connect with the Pearl River.

This project involves the realignment of the estuary channel for the Dakanggang River in Shenzhen, focusing on the construction of 884 meters of new seawalls on the north and south sides, protection for bridge piers along the adjacent highway, and dredging of the southern estuary. The key objectives include:
1. Flood and Tide Protection: To address flood discharge issues caused by obstructions from Bao'an Port, this project will create a new floodway connecting the north and south channels of the river to the Pearl River estuary, ensuring a robust flood and tide protection system.
2. Channel Dredging: The southern estuary will be dredged to enlarge the river's cross-section and improve its flood discharge capacity. This ensures safe flood management in alignment with regional development needs and planning principles. <br/>
