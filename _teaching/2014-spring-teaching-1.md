This project involved designing a seawall adjacent to an estuary within mangroves, where I led fieldwork for biomass surveys and erosion analysis. In the absence of specific Nature-based Solutions (NbS) guidelines, we creatively applied theoretical models and case studies to estimate a 20% reduction in wave height, allowing for a lower seawall height and resulting in a more cost-effective, nature-based coastal protection design.

Topographic Analysis and Bathymetry

excerpt: "In the cross-section, the park and its coastal protection feature three main functions. The first is a foreshore wave attenuation zone within the mangroves. This is followed by trapezoidal embankments that provide structural support. Behind the seawall, beautifully landscaped gardens connect seamlessly to the design. 
The structure employs a composite slope that enhances coastal resilience and integrates with the natural environment. A secondary platform is positioned outside the design boundary to facilitate habitat connectivity while maintaining open access to the seaward side. Below this platform, riprap is used to stabilize the connection with the existing riverbed, promoting erosion control and supporting the health of the mangrove ecosystem. <br/><img src='/images/work1-2.png'>"
