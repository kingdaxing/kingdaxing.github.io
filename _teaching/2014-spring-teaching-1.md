This project involved designing a seawall adjacent to an estuary within mangroves, where I led fieldwork for biomass surveys and erosion analysis. In the absence of specific Nature-based Solutions (NbS) guidelines, we creatively applied theoretical models and case studies to estimate a 20% reduction in wave height, allowing for a lower seawall height and resulting in a more cost-effective, nature-based coastal protection design.
