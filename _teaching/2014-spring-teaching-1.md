This project involved designing a seawall adjacent to an estuary within mangroves, where I led fieldwork for biomass surveys and erosion analysis. In the absence of specific Nature-based Solutions (NbS) guidelines, we creatively applied theoretical models and case studies to estimate a 20% reduction in wave height, allowing for a lower seawall height and resulting in a more cost-effective, nature-based coastal protection design.

Conceptual Design
======
This project aims to develop the coastal landscape along the Dongguan Binhai Bay in Shenzhen, China. 
Key objectives include:
1. Living Shoreline & Seawall Construction: A new seawall will be constructed to provide robust flood protection, designed for a 100-year flood return period. This seawall will incorporate and protect existing mangroves, creating a living shoreline that enhances coastal resilience and fosters a sustainable ecological marine environment.
2. Coastal Park Development: The project will create a vibrant coastal vitality park, incorporating greenway features that promote recreational use and ecological sustainability. <br/><img src='/images/work1-1.PNG'>

Topographic Analysis and Bathymetry
======
The proposed seawall is located at the Miaochong estuary in the Pearl River Delta, adjacent to the mangrove wetland. The existing inner area consists mainly of artificially filled land, with some sections designated as fish ponds. During the survey, the inner site was relatively flat; however, some areas exhibited significant undulations due to uneven fill. Ground elevations range from approximately 0.80m to 3.60m, while outer elevations near the mangroves vary from about 0.30m to 1.30m. <br/><img src='/images/work1-2.PNG'>

Cross-Profile
======
In the cross-section, the park and its coastal protection feature three main functions. The first is a foreshore wave attenuation zone within the mangroves. This is followed by trapezoidal embankments that provide structural support. Behind the seawall, beautifully landscaped gardens connect seamlessly to the design. <br/><img src='/images/work1-3.PNG'>

The structure employs a composite slope that enhances coastal resilience and integrates with the natural environment. A secondary platform is positioned outside the design boundary to facilitate habitat connectivity while maintaining open access to the seaward side. Below this platform, riprap is used to stabilize the connection with the existing riverbed, promoting erosion control and supporting the health of the mangrove ecosystem.  <br/><img src='/images/work1-4.PNG'>
