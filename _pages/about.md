Hey! This is Pan.

I completed my master's in Civil Engineering (Sustainable Climate Resilience) from the [National University of Singapore - College of Design and Engineering](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/) in June 2024, focusing on sediment transport in coastal-fluvial processes, experiments and mechanics of nature-based solutions (NbS) for coastal protection, vegetation dynamics in wetlands and marshes, numerical modeling (Delft3D), as well as artificial neural networks and DEMs for hydrological analysis. Additionally, I have two years of experience as a coastal engineer and consultant in Shenzhen, China, where I contributed to feasibility studies and led the design of a coastal protection project incorporating mangroves as an NbS. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Water and Hydropower Engineering from Hohai University in 2020.

My research interests include sediment transport and shoreline morphology, NbS for coastal protections, flow-sediment-vegetation interaction and numerical methods. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gary](https://www.garylei.com/) from NUS CEE, and I developed an interest in FSI and Environmental Fluid Mechanics through his classes and experiments. In terms of numerical methodS for sediment transport and ocean hydrodynamics modelling, I systematically learned from [Prof. Pearl](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/li-yuzhu-pearl/) at her [Computational Coastal Lab](https://nus-ccl.com/) and [Dr.Ooi](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/ooi-seng-keat/) at NUS, both of whom also advised me.
