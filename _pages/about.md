Hey! This is Pan.

I completed my master's in Civil Engineering (Sustainable Climate Resilience) from the [National University of Singapore](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/) in June 2024, focusing on sediment transport in coastal-fluvial processes, experiments and mechanics of nature-based solutions (NbS) for coastal protection, vegetation dynamics in wetlands and marshes, numerical modeling (Delft3D), as well as artificial neural networks and DEMs for hydrological analysis. Before that, I had two years of work experience as a coastal engineer and consultant in Shenzhen, China, where I contributed to feasibility studies and design projects for coastal protections and open-channel development, including a notable living shoreline design for coastal protection near an estuary surrounded by mangroves. My undergraduate studies were at Hohai University, China, in Water and Hydropower Engineering, focusing on fluvial hydraulics and sediment transport.

My research interests include sediment transport and shoreline morphology, NbS for coastal protections, flow-sediment-vegetation interaction and numerical methods. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gary](https://www.garylei.com/) from NUS CEE, and I developed an interest in FSI and Environmental Fluid Mechanics through his classes and experiments. In terms of numerical methodS for sediment transport and ocean hydrodynamics modelling, I systematically learned from [Prof. Pearl](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/li-yuzhu-pearl/) at her [Computational Coastal Lab](https://nus-ccl.com/) and [Dr.Ooi](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/ooi-seng-keat/) at NUS, both of whom also advised me.
