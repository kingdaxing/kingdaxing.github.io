I completed my master's in Civil Engineering (Sustainable Climate Resilience) from the [National University of Singapore - College of Design and Engineering](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/) in June 2024, focusing on nature-based solutions (NbS) for coastal protection, sediment transport, vegetation processes in wetlands and marshes, and numerical modeling (Delft3D), as well as artificial neural networks for hydrological analysis. 

My research interests includes sediment transport and coastal protections, nature-based solutions for coastal processes, flow-sediment-vegetation interaction and numerical methods. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gary](https://www.garylei.com/) from NUS CEE, and I developed an interest in FSI and Environmental Fluid Mechanics through his classes and experiments. In terms of numerical methodS for sediment transport and ocean hydrodynamics modelling, I systematically learned from [Prof. Pearl](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/li-yuzhu-pearl/) at her [Computational Coastal Lab](https://nus-ccl.com/) and [Dr.Ooi](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/ooi-seng-keat/) at NUS, both of whom also advised me.
