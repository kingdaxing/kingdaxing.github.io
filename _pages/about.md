Hey! This is Pan.

I am from Guangxi at Southeastern China, where a west tributary of the Pearl River flows through my city. Early exposure to this beautiful river has inevitably sparked a curiosity about the physics driving fluvial processes.

Throughout my academic and professional journey so far, I have developed a strong interest in pursuing research on topics related to sediment transport in coastal and fluvial processes, nature-based solutions, and shoreline morphodynamics.

My higher education journey began at Hohai University (HHU) in China, where I pursued a Bachelor of Engineering in Water and Hydropower Engineering, focusing on Hydraulics and Hydrology. During my junior year, I participated in the Hydraulics Lab and studied under Prof. Fu with interest, conducting research and solving flow-structure interaction and turbulence problems (e.g., hydraulic jumps in overflow weirs) using numerical methods (FLOW3D) and physical experiments.

Following HHU, I joined Shenzhen Water Planning & Design Institute Co., Ltd., China, that provided the perfect environment to integrate hydraulics with real-world Water and Coastal Engineering challenges. There were numerous opportunities for me to participate in design and consulting projects related to coastal protection, river channel, dam and reservoir. One notable project involved a road-river cross-engineering evaluation, where I proposed an effective interdisciplinary solution to mitigate the impact of bridge piers on the river, verified by integrating various numerical analyses. Additionally, one of my most impressive designs was a living shoreline adjacent to a Pearl River inlet within mangroves ([Seen in Works](https://kingdaxing.github.io/teaching/work-1-2022-Living-Shoreline)), that was my first exposure to nature-based solutions. However, I was not satisfied with current approaches for shoreline prediction considering sea level rise and wave attenuation of vegetation.

After 2-yr work and obtaining a professional qualification certificate of assistant engineer in water & coastal structure (river channels and coastal protections), I continued my academic journey at the [National University of Singapore](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/) (NUS), where I hold a master's degree in Civil Engineering (Sustainable Climate Resilience), and my research focused on small-scale sediment transport and cross- & long-shore sediment in shoreline modelling, NbS applications and eco-hydrology, numerical methods and ANNs modelling for prediction. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gary](https://www.garylei.com/) from NUS CEE, and I developed an interest in FSI and Environmental Fluid Mechanics through his classes and experiments. In terms of numerical method for sediment transport and ocean hydrodynamics modelling, I systematically learned from [Prof. Pearl](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/li-yuzhu-pearl/) at her [Computational Coastal Lab](https://nus-ccl.com/) and [Dr.Ooi](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/ooi-seng-keat/) at NUS, both of whom also advised me.

Outside of my studies, you can find me at basketball games. This has been my passion for 20 years, and I once led my college team to many victories.
