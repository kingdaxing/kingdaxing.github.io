This includes key academic projects focused on mixing and diffusion in estuarine circulation and thermal plume extent in the ocean, utilizing DELFT3D for hydrodynamic modeling. By optimizing model setups, selecting parameters, and conducting sensitivity analyses, these studies enhance the understanding of flow dynamics and thermal impacts in marine and estuarine environments, providing a strong foundation for further research on shoreline morphology using numerical methods.


Sub-Project 1: Mixing & Diffusion in Estuarine Circulation
======

This study examines the dynamics of the salt wedge in tide-dominated estuarine circulation by simulating the interaction between a freshwater river and the sea using Delft3D. I evaluated model lengths of 10 km, 20 km, and 50 km to identify optimal configurations while determining the necessary spin-up times to mitigate boundary effects. The sensitivity analysis revealed significant changes in the salt wedge structure with increasing tidal amplitudes (H=2m, H=5m) on the 10 km grid. Additionally, I provided an explanation of the Thatcher-Harleman method, which addresses the return time of concentrations from outflow to specified inflow values. <br/>

Sub-Project 2: Thermal Evaluation in 2D Ocean Modelling 
======

This project assesses the impact of a new thermal discharge at Location 8 and proposes a suitable location for an intake. A baseline simulation was conducted without the new discharge, followed by simulations with varying flow rates of the discharge to evaluate temperature changes. The analysis reveals that for Q=1.5xP, the temperature rise (ΔT) remains within acceptable limits (ΔT < 0.25°C), but for Q=2.5xP and Q=3.0xP, ΔT exceeds the 0.25°C threshold, especially during neap tides when heat dissipation is less efficient. The study recommends a maximum flow rate of Q=1.0xP to stay within regulatory temperature limits, though a slightly higher rate (Q=1.5xP) may be considered with relaxed criteria. The intake location near L8 is viable, but thermal impacts should be carefully considered. <br/>

Overall, my study experience enhances my understanding and skills of estuarine processes and strengthens my skills in hydrodynamic modeling.
