Nature-based solutions (NbS) and vegetation dynamics are another of my research interests during my masterâ€™s studies at NUS. I focus on mechanics and simulation methods for vegetation process, and NbS applications in coastal protection. 1) Effects of meteorological forcing, soil properties, and vegetation in tropical ecosystems areanalyzed using the Tethys-Chloris (T&C) model and statistical analysis. 2) Artificial submerged reefs are designed as a living shoreline at Byron Bay, using SWASH modeling for wave dynamics and field cases. <br/>
These projects strengthened my skills in statistical analysis, model simulations, and environmental design using scripting tools (R & MATLAB) and SWASH modeling.


Sub-Project 1: Sensitivity Analysis of Eco-Hydrology Properties based on T&C Model
======

This study presents a sensitivity analysis of eco-hydrological properties for tropic plants using [Tethys-Chloris (T&C) model](https://hyd.ifu.ethz.ch/research-data-models/t-c.html) to explore the impact of variations in meteorological forcing, soil properties, and vegetation traits on key ecosystem processes. Experiment 1 investigates how meteorological forcing changes affect evapotranspiration, transpiration, and carbon assimilation (GPP, NPP), revealing that atmospheric conditions, rather than soil properties, dominate carbon fluxes. Experiment 2 examines the influence of soil texture on soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater dynamics, showing minimal effects on GPP.  Statistical analysis, including indicators and multiple/simple linear regression, is conducted in R and MATLAB to identify dominant factors in vegetation and hydrological processes. <br/>

Sub-Project 2: A Living Shoreline Design for Erosion Mitigation in Main Beach, Byron Bay, NSW, AUS
======

This study proposes a living shoreline design for erosion mitigation at Main Beach, Byron Bay, Australia, utilizing artificial submerged reefs (ARs) as a nature-based solution (NbS). Byron Bay is experiencing significant coastal erosion, with current shoreline management focused on hard engineering approaches. ARs were selected, and their layout designed in the surf zone based on SWASH modeling results of wave dynamics, to attenuate wave energy, reduce sediment loss, and enhance ecosystem services. The study concludes that ARs, coupled with seagrass restoration, can stabilize the shoreline and improve ecological conditions, though high wave and tidal conditions may limit their performance. <br/>
