This includes my main academic projects about Sediment Transport in Fluvial-Coastal Processes, that is my core research interests. My research utilizes laboratory experiments and numerical models (e.g., FLOW3D and Matlab scripts).<br/>

Sub-Project 1: Channel Optimization Design & Sediment-Erosion Analysis (Thesis)
======

In my Master Core Module - Open Channel Hydraulics, I led a team to demonstrate efficacy of a channel widening optimization by assessing Fr number pre- and post-implementation. Secondly, we verified asymmetric weir effects in flow velocity and sediment, and illustrated how an optimal size of weir reduced TKE and suspension sediment. <br/><img src='/images/proj-sedi-1-1.PNG' alt='Image Description' width='400'> <br/>
This study investigates the optimization of the Shawan River channel in Shenzhen to enhance flood protection and balance sedimentation prevention with erosion control. Using MIKE and FLOW-3D models, the performance of natural and optimized channels under different flow conditions, including a 100-year return period storm, is analyzed. Results show that the optimized channel improves stability and efficiency, particularly in extreme conditions. A comparison of trapezoidal weirs with varying slopes highlights that milder slopes increase flow capacity, while steeper slopes heighten shear stress and erosion risks. These findings offer valuable insights for effective channel design. <br/><img src='/images/proj-sedi-1-2.PNG' alt='Image Description' width='450'> <br/>[Download Academic Writing](http://kingdaxing.github.io/files/NO1.pdf)


Sub-Project 2: Grain-size Effect on Bedload & Suspended Sediment within Current Processes
======

The assignment of Modelling of Bedload and Suspended Sediment in Steady Current involves creating a model to compute bedload and suspended sediment transport rates for a wide river, given sediment size, channel slope, and discharge. <br/><img src='/images/proj-sedi-2-1.png' alt='Image Description' width='300'><br/>
This analysis explores sediment transport in a wide river using a Matlab model. The study applies the Freds√∏e relation for reference sediment concentration and examines the Rouse parameter to model sediment suspension. The results show that suspended sediment transport increases with discharge, and transitions in bedforms (e.g., from dunes to plane bed) significantly influence sediment dynamics. For different grain sizes (1 mm and 0.3 mm), smaller particles demonstrate more uniform suspended-load distributions and lower Rouse numbers, indicating greater suspension and transport efficiency compared to larger particles. The study concludes that grain size, settling velocity, and bed shear stress are critical factors in determining sediment transport patterns. <br/><img src='/images/proj-sedi-2-2.PNG' alt='Image Description' width='400'> <br/>[Download Exercise](http://kingdaxing.github.io/files/Grain-Size-SSC.pdf)<br/>


Sub-Project 3: Surfzone Hydrodynamics & Simplified Shoreline Morphology Study 
======

This assignment focuses on analyzing surfzone hydrodynamics and longshore sediment transport. It includes:
1.	Data Analysis for Surfzone Hydrodynamics: Theoretical values are compared with measurements, showing strong agreement in the cross-shore direction for variables like velocity (uu), force (Fx), and radiation stress (Sxx), but deviations occur in the alongshore direction.

2.	Longshore Sediment Transport Comparison: The longshore sediment transport is evaluated using three methods: the CERC formula, Kamphuis's empirical formula (1986), and Deigaard's model-based formula (1986). Kamphuis's model, which incorporates sediment grain size variability, predicts higher sediment transport volumes compared to the other methods.
3.	Coastline Morphology Modeling: The assignment also involves simulating coastline changes over time due to groynes, which disrupt longshore sediment transport and affect the overall coastal morphology. <br/><img src='/images/proj-sedi-3-3.PNG' alt='Image Description' width='400'><br/>


Sub-Project 4: Flow-Sediment-Vegetation Interaction Study 
======

In my study with Prof. Gary, I learned to model flow development within seagrass meadows to understand how vegetation affects hydrodynamics and sediment transport. By analyzing flow conditions around submerged and emerged flexible blades, I aim to investigate the impact of this marsh vegetation on sediment deposition and resuspension. <br/><img src='/images/proj-sedi-4-1.PNG' alt='Image Description' width='600'>
